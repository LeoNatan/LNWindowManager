LNWindowManager
===============

A window manager that makes working with ```UIWindow``` objects easily using an API similar to the ```UIViewController``` modal presentation API.

Currently, only iOS7 has been properly tested, but should work fine on iOS6.

This is a complex topic and there may be some flows which I have not considered. Please help me make this library as complete as possible.

Thanks,
